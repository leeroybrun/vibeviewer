# AIUsageTracker Comprehensive Feature Integration Plan

## Objectives
- Incorporate advanced ingestion, analytics, personalization, and automation capabilities inspired by ccusage, Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor, VibeMeter, CursorLens, and cursor-stats.
- Deliver production-ready implementations with testing, documentation, and UX polish aligned with macOS best practices.
- Maintain security posture by ensuring new features respect Keychain-backed credential storage and privacy expectations.

## Workstreams

### 1. Incremental Data Pipelines & Proxy Ingestion
- [x] Extend Cursor usage refresh to track watermarks (timestamp + event id) and only fetch incremental updates.
- [x] Add local log cache with retention policy configurable via advanced settings.
- [x] Provide optional local HTTP proxy (per CursorLens) that records IDE traffic and imports records into the unified usage store.

### 2. Advanced Aggregation & Predictive Analytics
- [x] Implement reusable aggregation engine that supports presets: 5-hour windows, sessions, daily/weekly/monthly, per-provider totals.
- [x] Add percentile-based forecasting (P90) and burn-rate calculations with alert thresholds.
- [x] Surface predictive warnings in UI and notifications when approaching configured budgets.
- [x] Compare Cursor subscription value against estimated provider API pricing with configurable plan costs and per-model overrides.

### 3. Personalization & Localization
- [x] Auto-detect timezone, locale, and macOS appearance to tailor date formatting, currency display, and theming.
- [x] Expand localization files (English + new languages) and currency conversion support with live FX rates.
- [x] Introduce plan detection heuristics to adjust default thresholds per provider.

### 4. Developer Integrations & Automation
- [x] Export compact status lines and JSON snapshots for external tools.
- [x] Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) / WebSocket bridge to stream usage updates.
- [x] Automate Cursor credential extraction from VS Code state database with user consent.

### 5. UX & Notification Enhancements
- [x] Replace static menu icon with animated gauge reflecting spend progress.
- [x] Introduce live monitoring mode with real-time auto-refresh and sparklines.
- [x] Provide in-app alert center, macOS notifications, and configurable badge behavior.

### 6. Configuration, Logging, and Diagnostics
- [x] Create advanced JSON configuration file with JSON Schema for validation.
- [x] Integrate structured logging with rotation and shareable diagnostics bundle generation.
- [x] Document troubleshooting flows in new handbook section.

### 7. Documentation & Testing
- [x] Update READMEs, help docs, and onboarding guides to reflect new features.
- [x] Add unit tests for aggregation engine, forecasting, proxy ingestion, and credential automation helpers.
- [x] Provide QA checklist and automated lint/test commands in CI scripts.

## Dependencies & Milestones
1. **Foundation Update** – Incremental data pipelines, config schema, and secure storage adjustments.
2. **Analytics Expansion** – Aggregations, forecasting, and personalization.
3. **UX & Integration** – UI polish, notifications, developer bridges, proxy ingestion.
4. **Documentation & QA** – Localization, docs, tests, diagnostics.

Each milestone must pass linters/tests and include end-user documentation updates prior to completion.
